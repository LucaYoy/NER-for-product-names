    "- add evaluation metric on validation data to see how well model performs. At the moment i only used training loss to gauge the performance however precision,recall,f1 should also be computed.\n",
    "- deal with texts which go over model limit. A solution would be to break the texts into smaller chunks in case they are too big and then use those for training (this way we dont lose any data and will have more training data), also for inference we could do the same and feed to the model more chunks broken from a single webpage.\n",

In the end i chose to use llm to give me a list of the products found in the text and then use that list to tag each word. This turned out to be a pretty good method and i was able to produce a reliable dataset. I also chose to use the webpages which had a clear indication of what the main section is in the html, thankfully these were plenty for training.\n",
    "- I also struggled with training. At first i tried using the high level Trainer class from huggingface, however after training for a couple of epochs the model was not predicting anything and it was telling me that there was no log of the training loss. I then also tried training with my own training loop and printed the loss at the end of every epoch, i have seen that the loss is indeed decreasing which made me realise that i need to train for way more epochs than i first did. Therefore i believe my mistake was not training for long enough which made the Trainer class not display accurate metrics for the first few epochs."
